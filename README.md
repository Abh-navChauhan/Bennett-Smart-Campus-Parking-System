# Bennett-Smart-Campus-Parking-System
A Python-based parking management system for Bennett University, built to reduce event-day chaos by tracking and allotting parking slots in real time. Guided by Mr. Akhil Kumar and inspired by SCSET Dean Dr. Abhay Bansal, our team created a simple, efficient tool for smoother traffic flow and better visitor experience.
