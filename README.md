This project is a Python-based Parking Management System designed to streamline vehicle entry, exit, and space allocation on the Bennett University campus. It solves key issues such as inefficient parking utilization, long wait times, and lack of real-time information for students, faculty, and visitors.

Built using Python, Tkinter for GUI, and SQLite for database, the system enables users to register vehicles, generate tickets, track parking duration, and calculate fees automatically. The interface is clean, responsive, and easy to operate even for first-time users.

Administrators can add or manage parking slots, view occupancy, and track vehicle history. Automated validations ensure accurate data entry and minimize human error.

The project emphasizes usability, reliability, and scalability, making it suitable for campus-wide implementation. It also lays the foundation for future enhancements like QR-based entry, IoT sensors, and mobile app integration.
